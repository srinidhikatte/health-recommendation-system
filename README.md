# health-recommendation-system
Health recommendation system, which can be used by doctors and other medical staff in hospitals, to know about disease predictions of the patients in the hospital and it will enable them to decide treatment plans for the patients and stop further spreading of diseases.
We have used open source data available on the Internet to train our Machine learning (ML) models and disease prediction for new patients will be based on the output from the ML models.
Our dataset consists of information of various vital health parameters like blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose level etc and also we have used  blood smear specimen image, CT scan image and activity graph of the patients.Our application is deployed in AWS Cloud. We have used AWS S3 for storing images and CSV files related to patients and AWS Dynamo DB for storing other patient related information and URL of files stored in S3. We have trained our ML models using scikit learn and tensor flow libraries which will give predictions of diabetes, heart disease, covid, pneumonia, malaria and mental depression based on the patient information. We have used Python Flask library to develop our web application for displaying health recommendation information.
